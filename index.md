## About this website!
Hello website visitors! This website is meant to be a joke website and shouldn't be taken seriously. The people in the band are not in the band, however they are real people who work in the technology business.

This website is meant to have an educational aspect to it, however I can't really add anything educational but I will try my hardest!
