# A little bit of a backstory about The Pirates.
I was asked by my Media Studies teacher to create a band, with:
- A promotional poster.
- A CD cover.
- Band logo.

I wanted to make a website for my band, so here we are, [The Pirates](https://wearethepirates.pcoh.uk).

The website isn't going to be that good as it's not meant to be a real, fully functional website.
